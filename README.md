# 3D-Modelling

3D modelling is the process of creating three-dimensional representations of an object or a surface. 
3D models are made within computer-based 3D modelling software, which we'll explore a little later.
During the 3D modelling process, an object's size, shape, and texture can be determined.

I have done 3D models starting from basic level to intermediate level.
